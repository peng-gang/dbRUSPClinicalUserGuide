# Two Continuous Variables 

As mentioned earlier, the application by default selects two continuous variables for correlation, Gestational age (weeks) on X axis and Birth Weight (g) on Y axis. The other options, stratification variable one, stratification variable two, show dots, log scale for x axis, log scale for y axis, and confidence interval, allow the user to modify the plots. For now, let us keep all the options to default and see the resultant plot.

## Basic correlation plot

When all the options are left to default and are submitted, the following correlation plot is generated.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
