The objective of this application is to allow the user to visualize the newborn clinical data. This application allows the user to find the relation between any two variables of the newborn clinical dataset. 1.1 Usage The dbRUSPClinical application has two pages. One is the About page, which clearly explains the need of the dbRUSPClinical web application. The other page is the correlation page, which allows the user to select the variables for correlation. 1.2 Correlation Here is a glimpse of the correlation page. By default, two continuous variables, Gestational age (weeks) on X axis and Birth Weight (g) on Y axis are preselected when the application starts running. This can be seen from the figure above that Gestational age (weeks) is selected as variable one and Birth Weight (g) is selected as variable two. There are other fields in the page such as the stratification variable one and stratification variable two. These two variables allow the user to select categorical variables. This allows the data to be divided into different groups based on the unique values of these categorical variables and these grouped data points are shown separately in the plots. This is shown clearly later in this document. For now, only the variable one and variable two are selected. The other options are check boxes that allow the user to modify the plots to show or hide the data points, to change the scale for X and Y axis, and to include or exclude the confidence interval. All these options are pertaining to the plots generated for two continuous variables. So, by default the correlation page of the dbRUSPClinical application will show you the options relevant for plots between two continuous variables. These options will vary if other types of variable combinations are selected. Let us explore the plot results of each variable combination in the next chapters. "],["two-continuous-variables.html", "Chapter 2 Two Continuous Variables 2.1 Basic correlation plot", " Chapter 2 Two Continuous Variables As mentioned earlier, the application by default selects two continuous variables for correlation, Gestational age (weeks) on X axis and Birth Weight (g) on Y axis. The other options, stratification variable one, stratification variable two, show dots, log scale for x axis, log scale for y axis, and confidence interval, allow the user to modify the plots. For now, let us keep all the options to default and see the resultant plot. 2.1 Basic correlation plot When all the options are left to default and are submitted, the following correlation plot is generated.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2023) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
