[["index.html", "dbRUSPClinical - User Guide Chapter 1 About 1.1 Usage 1.2 Correlation", " dbRUSPClinical - User Guide Hari Naga Sai Kiran Suryadevara 2023-08-08 Chapter 1 About dbRUSPClinical is a web application that is built using R shiny. The objective of this application is to allow the user to visualize the newborn clinical data. This application allows the user to find the relation between any two variables of the newborn clinical dataset. 1.1 Usage The dbRUSPClinical application has two pages. One is the About page, which clearly explains the need of the dbRUSPClinical web application. The other page is the correlation page, which allows the user to select the variables for correlation. 1.2 Correlation Here is a glimpse of the correlation page. By default, two continuous variables, Gestational age (weeks) on X axis and Birth Weight (g) on Y axis are preselected when the application starts running. This can be seen from the figure above that Gestational age (weeks) is selected as variable one and Birth Weight (g) is selected as variable two. There are other fields in the page such as the stratification variable one and stratification variable two. These two variables allow the user to select categorical variables. This allows the data to be divided into different groups based on the unique values of these categorical variables and these grouped data points are shown separately in the plots. This is shown clearly later in this document. For now, only the variable one and variable two are selected. The other options are check boxes that allow the user to modify the plots to show or hide the data points, to change the scale for X and Y axis, and to include or exclude the confidence interval. All these options are pertaining to the plots generated for two continuous variables. So, by default the correlation page of the dbRUSPClinical application will show you the options relevant for plots between two continuous variables. These options will vary if other types of variable combinations are selected. Let us explore the plot results of each variable combination in the next chapters. "],["two-continuous-variables.html", "Chapter 2 Two Continuous Variables 2.1 Basic correlation plot 2.2 Correlation plots with one stratification variable 2.3 Correlation plots with two stratification variables 2.4 Technical details", " Chapter 2 Two Continuous Variables As mentioned earlier, the application by default selects two continuous variables for correlation, Gestational age (weeks) on X axis and Birth Weight (g) on Y axis. The other options, stratification variable one, stratification variable two, show dots, log scale for x axis, log scale for y axis, and confidence interval, allow the user to modify the plots. For now, let us keep all the options to default and see the resultant plot. 2.1 Basic correlation plot When all the options are left to default and are submitted, the following correlation plot is generated. The following options were selected for the above plot and all the check boxes were unchecked. When all the check boxes are selected as below, The plot will be modified as, In the above plot, both the axes have been changed to logarithmic scale, data points and confidence interval were added. You can also notice that two slide bars appear on the side panel to help the user to adjust the height and width of the plots. Now that we have seen a basic correlation between two continuous variables, let us use stratification variables to see how the plots change. 2.2 Correlation plots with one stratification variable The user has the option to divide the entire dataset based on a categorical variable and view the correlation between selected variables for each category. For example, the user can select Sex as the stratification variable to see the correlation between selected variables for each gender. The selected options would be as follows, When the user selects the options as shown in the above picture, a basic correlation plot is generated as seen before along with a new plot depicting correlation between the selected variables for each category of the selected stratification variable, which is Sex in this example. The new plot would be as follows, We can notice in the above plot that the entire data is divided based on gender and the correlation between selected variables is plotted seperately for each gender. The same set of plots are generated when the user selects a stratification variable two and selects nothing for stratification variable one. This means, the application generates a basic correlation plot and a correlation plot showing distinctive correlation lines for each category of the selected stratification variable whenever the user selects any one stratification variable, i.e., either stratification variable one or stratification variable two along with the variables for correlation. 2.3 Correlation plots with two stratification variables Finally the user has the option to select two stratification variables. When the user does select both of them, a basic correlation plot between the selected variables, two plots showing correlation between the selected variables separately for each category of both the stratification variables (One plot for each stratification variable) and two plots showing correlation between the selected variables where in each plot the data is stratified using both the selected stratification variables are shown. For example, let us consider that the user selects Sex as stratification variable one and Ethnicity(major) as stratification variable two as below, The following plots are generated apart from the basic correlation plot. Correlation lines shown separately for each Sex. Correlation lines shown separately for each Ethnicity(major). Data is wrapped by Ethnicity(major) and correlation lines shown separately for each Sex. Data is wrapped by Sex and correlation lines shown separately for each Ethnicity(major). Now that we have seen different kinds of plots the application generates when a user selects two continuous variables and different stratification variables, let us look into some technical details. 2.4 Technical details In all the plots, the smooth lines are added using the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) unless and until a particular group of data has two little unique X values. When this case arises, Linear Model is used for modelling the relationship between the selected variables. For example, if the user selects Ethnicity(detail) as the stratification variable, then certain ethnicity groups might have less data points (less unique X values) to support the GAM method. In such cases, LM method is used only for the ethnicities that have less number of data points. For all the plots generated, the user can add data points to the plot by selecting the check box Show dots, change X and Y axis scales to logarithmic by selecting the appropriate check boxes and add the confidence interval to the smooth lines by selecting the Confidence Interval check box. The user can also adjust the height and width of the plots by adjusting the values of the slide bars that appear on the side panel. "],["two-categorical-variables.html", "Chapter 3 Two Categorical Variables 3.1 Basic plots 3.2 Plots with one stratification variable 3.3 Plots with two stratification variables", " Chapter 3 Two Categorical Variables The dbRUSPClinical application generates a different set of plots when the two variables selected by the user are categorical. Let us examine these plots in this chapter. 3.1 Basic plots When the user selects two categorical variables for variable one and variable two, and do not select any variables for stratification variable one and stratification variable two as below, The application generates one bar plot and one counts plot. Barplot: Countsplot: It is clear that the plots are showing sample sizes. When the plots are generated, the users are given an option to switch between sample sizes and sample proportions. On the side panel, the user can select an appropriate radio button to see either the sample sizes or the sample proportions. See the below image. When the user switches the option to Sample proportion, the bar plot and the counts plot shown above are transformed to show sample proportions. Barplot(proportions): Countsplot(proportions): Now that we have seen the basic plots, let us see how the plots change when the user selects stratification variables. 3.2 Plots with one stratification variable When the user selects only one stratification variabe, i.e., either stratification variable one or stratification variable two, along with the variable one and variable two, the basic plots as seen in the previous section would be generated, and along with them, two more plots are shown. One counts plot where the counts are shown separately for each category of the selected stratification variable and one bar plot with inbuilt distinct plots for each category of the selected stratification variable. For example, if the user selects Sex as the stratification variable, the following two plots are shown along with the basic plots. When the user selects sample proportions instead of sample size, the above plots would be transformed as below. In the Counts plot, when the user selects the sample proportions option, the proportions are grouped by the variables and are shown separately for each variable. For example, in the above counts plot, the User has selected Gestational Age(Group) and Birth Weight(Group). We can see that two separate plots are shown for each gender. In the plot where the data points are grouped by Gestational Age(Group), the proportions are shown separately, for each of its categories. This is same with the other variable Birth Weight(Group). 3.3 Plots with two stratification variables If the user selects two stratification variables, say Sex and Ethnicity(Major), then the application generates the plots shown in previous section for both the selected stratification variables. This means that, one more set of Counts plot and the Bar plot are generated for the stratification variable Ethnicity(Major). The plots shown above depict sample sizes. The user always has an option to change the view to sample proportions. However, generating proportion plots might take time, depending upon the stratification variables the user selects. "],["one-continuous-and-one-categorical.html", "Chapter 4 One Continuous and One Categorical 4.1 Basic plots 4.2 Plots with one stratification variable 4.3 Plots with two stratification variables", " Chapter 4 One Continuous and One Categorical The appropriate plots for depicting relationship between one continuous variable and one categorical variable are, box plot and violin plot. The dbRUSPClinial application employs a violin plot with an embedded box plot to depict the relationship between one continuous variable and one categorical variable. 4.1 Basic plots Let us examine the basic plots that are shown, whenver the user selects a continuous variable and a categorical variable. For example, if a user selects Birth Weight(Group) as variable one and Gestational age(Weeks) as variable two, the following plot is shown by the application. Here, a continuous variable - Gestational age(Weeks) is selected as variable two and the categorical variable - Birth Weight (Group) is selected as variable one. It is always convenient to select a continuous variable as variable two and categorical variable as variable one as in this case, the violins and the boxes in the plot are shown clearly in a vertical fashion. If the user selects otherwise, then the violins and the boxes are shown in horizontal fashion, making the plot clumsy and congested. 4.2 Plots with one stratification variable In the previous section, we have seen a basic plot showing relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable. Let us now see, what kind of plots are shown, when a user selects one stratification variable, i.e., either stratification variable one or stratification variable two. For instance, if the user selects Sex as the stratification variable, Then separate plots are shown for each sex with different colors as below. 4.3 Plots with two stratification variables If the user selects both the stratification variables, then the application shows one basic plot, one plot each for both the stratification variables where the data is shown separately for each category of the corresponding stratification variable and two plots with each plot depicting the data that is grouped using both the stratification variables. For example, let’s say that the user selects stratification variables Sex and Ethnicity(Major). Then the application shows the following plots along with the basic plot and the plot for grouping data by Sex as shown in the previous section. Plot showing the data by grouping it based on the variable Ethnicity(Major) Two more plots are shown, where in one plot the data is separated by one stratification variable and each separated data set is shown in a different grid and in each grid the data is further grouped by the other stratification variable. In the other plot, the stratification variables are swapped for data separation and grouping. For the selected stratification variables Sex and Ethnicity(Major), these two plots would like the following. Data separated by Ethnicity(Major) and grouped by Sex: Data separated by Sex and grouped by Ethnicity(Major): It can be seen that the grouped categories are shown in different colors. "],["error-messages.html", "Chapter 5 Error Messages 5.1 Inappropriate variables selected 5.2 Same variables 5.3 Same stratification variables 5.4 Similar variables error", " Chapter 5 Error Messages The application shows different kinds of error messages when the user makes inappropriate selections. Let us decipher the meaning of different error messages. 5.1 Inappropriate variables selected It is mandatory for the user to select variable one and variable two for the application to show the relationship between the two variables. So, the user must select these two variables. If the user does not select any one variable or both the variables, the following error message is shown. It must be noted that it is not mandatory for the user to select stratification variables. These variables can be left to blank, i.e., “Select an option”. 5.2 Same variables The variable one and variable two shall always be different. If at all the user selects same variables, the following error message is displayed. 5.3 Same stratification variables The stratification variable one and stratification variable two shall always be different. If at all the user selects same stratification variables, the following error message is displayed. 5.4 Similar variables error The data contains certain continuous variables and the continuous data of these variables is categorized into groups to form new variables which are categorical in nature. For example, Gestational age(Weeks) is a continuous variable. The data of this variable is transformed into categories and is stored under a new variable Gestational age(Group). Therefore, it does not make sense to select Gestational age(Weeks) as a variable and Gestational age(Group) as a stratification variable or vice versa, as these variables are similar. If the user does select these or such sort of variables, then the application returns the following error message. Also, it is not appropriate to select two similar variables. For example, a user cannot select Gestational age(Weeks) as variable one and Gestational age(Group) as variable two or vice versa. If done so, the following error message is displayed.
